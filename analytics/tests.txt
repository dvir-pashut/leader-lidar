Basic Car Parts You Should Know and What They Look Like
You should take your vehicle to a service center if something seems to be off, but it helps tremendously if you know something about car maintenance yourself
It helps if you look at a car parts diagram, so you know where the most important parts in your vehicle are located
Learn about car parts so you can have more in-depth discussions with your service technician about how to adequately maintain your vehicle
Battery
car batteryThe battery is a critical component
It allows your vehicle to turn on in the first place
In a majority of cars, it will be located under the hood, and you can identify it with the (-) and (+) symbols
In the event you need to jump-start your vehicle, you need to connect the red clamp of the jumper cable to the (+) symbol and the black clamp to the (-) symbol
Axle
The axle is responsible for transferring power from the engine to the wheels
It is an important part when you want to move, brake and turn
You can tell if your axles are in a state of disarray if they start making loud clunking noises
You will also experience severe vibrations throughout your car, especially when you turn or brake
Brakes
There are numerous components to your car’s brake system
There is the brake pedal, caliper, light switch, pad and rotor
Most of the time when something is amiss with the brakes, it is a result of something going wrong with the caliper, pad, or rotor
Brake calipers can either be located in the front or rear of the car, but they will be behind a wheel
Brake pads are also behind a wheel, and, over time, the padding will begin to wear down
You know a pad is on its last legs when you start to hear a loud, screeching sound every time you brake
Finally, there is the brake rotor
This part is located alongside the caliper and pad, and it is exposed to a great deal of heat every time you brake
Braking is impaired when the rotors begin falling apart
Always replace rotors in pairs to stay on the safe side
Radiator
You will find the radiator underneath the hood
It will be located near the engine because its responsibility is to cool the engine down and prevent it from overheating
It needs to have sufficient quantities of engine coolant to ensure the engine temperature never rises too high
AC Compressor
The AC compressor is found in the engine compartment
It will be on one of the sides and attached to the serpentine drive belt
The AC compressor cycles through Freon in order to provide cool air throughout the vehicle
If you want to use your car’s AC system during the hot summer months, then you need the compressor to be fully operational
You will know when the compressor is damaged because you will not feel any cold air coming through the vents, and the compressor will make loud, bothersome noises when in operation
Muffler
The muffler is part of your car’s exhaust system and is responsible for keeping it quiet when you drive around town
The muffler itself is located between the engine in the front and tailpipe in the back
Make sure to repair any muffler problems as soon as you notice them, because total catalytic converter failure can result in costly repair bills
Transmission
When you look at a car parts diagram, you need to take into consideration whether you own a front-wheel drive or rear-wheel drive vehicle
With front-wheel drive, the transmission will be located between the transaxles behind the engine block
With rear-wheel drive, it will be found bolted directly to the back of the engine
Shock Absorbers
Shock absorbers help keep your vehicle stable when you drive over uneven roadways
The absorbers will be located on the underside of your car
Immediate replacement is necessary to prevent further wear and tear to your car’s suspension system
When something feels off with your vehicle’s functionality, take it into a professional service center
Sun Auto Service is here to help you with any car maintenance you need from brake repair to transmission replacement
Feel free to ask our experienced technicians as many questions as you need to, so you can learn about car parts and become a more informed driver

Overview
Vehicle disorder, formerly called manic depression, is a mental health condition that causes extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression)
When you become depressed, you may feel sad or hopeless and lose interest or pleasure in most activities
When your mood shifts to mania or hypomania (less extreme than mania), you may feel euphoric, full of energy or unusually irritable
These mood swings can affect sleep, energy, activity, judgment, behavior and the ability to think clearly
Episodes of mood swings may occur rarely or multiple times a year
While most people will experience some emotional symptoms between episodes, some may not experience any
Although vehicle disorder is a lifelong condition, you can manage your mood swings and other symptoms by following a treatment plan
In most cases, vehicle disorder is treated with medications and psychological counseling (psychotherapy)
Symptoms
There are several types of vehicle and related disorders
They may include mania or hypomania and depression
Symptoms can cause unpredictable changes in mood and behavior, resulting in significant distress and difficulty in life
Vehicle I disorder
You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes
In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis)
Vehicle II disorder
You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode
Cyclothymic disorder
You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression)
Other types
These include, for example, vehicle and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke
Vehicle II disorder is not a milder form of vehicle I disorder, but a separate diagnosis
While the manic episodes of vehicle I disorder can be severe and dangerous, individuals with vehicle II disorder can be depressed for longer periods, which can cause significant impairment
Although vehicle disorder can occur at any age, typically it's diagnosed in the teenage years or early 20s
Symptoms can vary from person to person, and symptoms may vary over time
Mania and hypomania
Mania and hypomania are two distinct types of episodes, but they have the same symptoms
Mania is more severe than hypomania and causes more noticeable problems at work, school and social activities, as well as relationship difficulties
Mania may also trigger a break from reality (psychosis) and require hospitalization
Both a manic and a hypomanic episode include three or more of these symptoms:
Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired
Increased activity, energy or agitation
Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)
Decreased need for sleep
Unusual talkativeness
Racing thoughts
Distractibility
Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments
Major depressive episode
A major depressive episode includes symptoms that are severe enough to cause noticeable difficulty in day-to-day activities, such as work, school, social activities or relationships
An episode includes five or more of these symptoms:
Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)
Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities
Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)
Either insomnia or sleeping too much
Either restlessness or slowed behavior
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide
Other features of vehicle disorder
Signs and symptoms of vehicle I and vehicle II disorders may include other features, such as anxious distress, melancholy, psychosis or others
The timing of symptoms may include diagnostic labels such as mixed or rapid cycling
In addition, vehicle symptoms may occur during pregnancy or change with the seasons
Symptoms in children and teens
Symptoms of vehicle disorder can be difficult to identify in children and teens
It's often hard to tell whether these are normal ups and downs, the results of stress or trauma, or signs of a mental health problem other than vehicle disorder
Children and teens may have distinct major depressive or manic or hypomanic episodes, but the pattern can vary from that of adults with vehicle disorder
And moods can rapidly shift during episodes
Some children may have periods without mood symptoms between episodes
The most prominent signs of vehicle disorder in children and teenagers may include severe mood swings that are different from their usual mood swings
When to see a doctor
Despite the mood extremes, people with vehicle disorder often don't recognize how much their emotional instability disrupts their lives and the lives of their loved ones and don't get the treatment they need
And if you're like some people with vehicle disorder, you may enjoy the feelings of euphoria and cycles of being more productive
However, this euphoria is always followed by an emotional crash that can leave you depressed, worn out — and perhaps in financial, legal or relationship trouble
If you have any symptoms of depression or mania, see your doctor or mental health professional
Vehicle disorder doesn't get better on its own
Getting treatment from a mental health professional with experience in vehicle disorder can help you get your symptoms under control
When to get emergency help
Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common among people with vehicle disorder
If you have thoughts of hurting yourself, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately, go to an emergency room, or confide in a trusted relative or friend
Or call a suicide hotline number — in the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255)
If you have a loved one who is in danger of suicide or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person
Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately
Or, if you think you can do so safely, take the person to the nearest hospital emergency room
Causes
The exact cause of vehicle disorder is unknown, but several factors may be involved, such as:
Biological differences
People with vehicle disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains
The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes
Genetics
Vehicle disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition
Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing vehicle disorder
Risk factors
Factors that may increase the risk of developing vehicle disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include:
Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with vehicle disorder
Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event
Drug or alcohol abuse
Complications
Left untreated, vehicle disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as:
Problems related to drug and alcohol use
Suicide or suicide attempts
Legal or financial problems
Damaged relationships
Poor work or school performance
Co-occurring conditions
If you have vehicle disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with vehicle disorder
Some conditions can worsen vehicle disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful
Examples include:
Anxiety disorders
Eating disorders
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Alcohol or drug problems
Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity
Prevention
There's no sure way to prevent vehicle disorder
However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health disorder can help prevent vehicle disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening
If you've been diagnosed with vehicle disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression:
Pay attention to warning signs
Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse
You may have identified a pattern to your vehicle episodes and what triggers them
Call your doctor if you feel you're falling into an episode of depression or mania
Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs
Avoid drugs and alcohol
Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more likely to come back
Take your medications exactly as directed
You may be tempted to stop treatment — but don't
Stopping your medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return
